# Vector Multiplication Function

## Overview

This repository hosts a Python script, vector_multiplication_function.py, designed to perform vector multiplication operations. The script includes functionality for both dot product and cross product calculations, making it suitable for various applications in physics, engineering, and computer graphics.

## Features

1) Dot Product Calculation: Computes the scalar product of two vectors, which is essential for projecting one vector onto another or determining the angle between vectors.
2) Cross Product Calculation: Determines the vector product of two vectors, useful for finding a vector perpendicular to the plane containing the initial vectors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Ensure Python is installed on your system. No additional libraries are required for the basic operations as implemented.
